1.Install Arduino IDE if you don't have the software. can be downloaded here 
  https://code.google.com/p/arduino/downloads/detail?name=arduino-1.0.5-windows.execan=2
2.copy the Arduino-IRremote-master file that has been provided and then open the Arduino 
  file on your computer at local disk/programfiles/arduino/libraries Paste the file
  Arduino-IRremote-master tsdi.
3.Run the Arduino IDE software, click File open and select the IR_Receiver file that 
  has been provided or simply double-click on the IR_receiver.ino file
4.prepare Arduino uno
5.plug in the T-sop or IR Receiver included in the package. we have given the color on 
  each leg of the T-Sop, red for Vcc, Black for Gnd, and blue or yellow for
  to enter analog pin A0.
6.connect the arduino that has been installed with T-sop and upload the IR_receiver. if successful, 
  open Serial Monitor on Arduino IDE. by clicking on the magnifying glass icon in the right corner
 software, and a new window will appear now press a button from the remote that has been provided. 
 if a number or value comes out, it means you have succeeded in the first
 stage.now open the IR_Onggobot.ino file after it appears click the ir_command_codes.h option and 
 a command for the robot action will appear. your task now replaces the value
 XXXXXXX in ir_command_codes.h with the number of each key you selected to perform the command. 
 for example, you select button no.1 to go forward then press the number button 1
 and the serial monitor will display a value for example 12345678 and now open the ir_command_codes.h 
 window where you have entered the number from pressing button one to
 'const long IR_COMMAND_FORWARD_CODES[] = { xxxxxxxxx };'you change xxxx with the value 12345678  
  obtained from serial monitor button no.1 so 'const long IR_COMMAND_FORWARD_CODES[] = { 12345678 };
  and select another button for reverse turn command and others.
7.if everything is filled now, upload ir.kolomonggobot.ino to arduino. when Upload done. 
  means the robot is ready to receive commands from the remote control earlier.
8.Install battery and your robot is ready
